## Fundamentals Algorithms and Data Structures in Python

This repository provides fundamental algorithms and data structures written using Python. It draws inspiration from sources, such as [Neetcode 150](https://neetcode.io/practice), [Grokking Algorithms](https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-algorithms), 
and [CS6.006](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-spring-2020/). Explore this collection to enhance your coding abilities and gain a deeper understanding of concepts of computer science. Author: [Dilmurod Abdusamadov](https://www.github.com/thisisdilmurod).

## Contents

1. **Algorithms**: Discover a wide variety of algorithms for sorting, searching, graph traversal, etc.

2. **Data Structures**: Learn how to create and use data structures such as arrays, linked lists, trees, stacks, and queues.
